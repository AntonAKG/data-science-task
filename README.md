# Social Media and Data Analysis with Pandas & Matplotlib

## Overview
This project contains multiple data analysis tasks using `pandas` and `matplotlib`. Each task focuses on different aspects of data visualization and statistical analysis. The project is structured as a set of Python scripts that analyze real-world data, such as student performance, weather trends, and social media popularity.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Sales Data Analysis
- Load sales data from a CSV file.
- Identify the month with the highest sales.
- Visualize monthly sales trends using a line plot.

### Task 2: Student Performance Analysis
- Create a `DataFrame` with student names, grades in different subjects, and attendance rates.
- Compute the average grade for each student.
- Identify students with an average grade below 50%.
- Display a bar chart with student performance.

### Task 3: Weather Data Analysis
- Load temperature data for an entire year.
- Compute the average temperature for each month.
- Visualize temperature trends using a scatter plot.
- Add a trend line to show temperature variation over the months.

### Task 4: (Optional) Additional Data Analysis Tasks
- Additional custom tasks can be added here.

### Task 5: Social Media Popularity Analysis
- Create a `DataFrame` with user statistics for different social media platforms over the past five years.
- Generate a stacked bar chart to illustrate the growth of various platforms.
- Label the axes and add a title for better readability.
